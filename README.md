# ðŸ‘·WebApp Work-in ProgressðŸ‘·
  - Plan to complete the design and functionality by Winter 2024


# Summary
Hello y'all, this is a MERN stack website (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJs) I am working on for my personal tailor and alterations business.
I hope to make this website publicaly accessible and allow users to submit requests for personal sewing jobs.

### Goals: 
  - To learn about how web applications work in front and backend code
  - I am curious about how different frameworks are utilized in different parts of the development process vs production process
  - Learn about API's
  - Gain creative and aesthetic design skills

# Design

# Development Process
  - Using Vite to develop the frontend aspects of the website
  - Currently learning how to host a website with the front end and backend on the same server
    - Hopefully so users can submit requests for alterations, which are then sent through the backend node.js to MongoDB
    - Will most likely use AWS EC2 to host so that I can better learn about popular Cloud Services
